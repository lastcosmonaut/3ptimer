# 3ptimer
Productivity, Pairing, Pause Timer

# Why another app?
Currently I use "Minutes" for pairing and "Healthier" for pausing.
However I saw the two timers diverge, so I wanted the functionality in one app.


Warning: Early Alpha Version ;)

# How to start the app:

```
java -jar ppptimer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 600 300 4
```

1st arg: Pairing session duration in seconds (10 Minutes)

2nd arg: Pause duration in seconds (5 Minutes)

3rd arg: How many pairing sessions before pause? (after 40 minutes)
